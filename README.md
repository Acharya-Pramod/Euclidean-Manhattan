**Euclidean Distance:**
Euclidean distance is a measure of straight-line distance between two points in Euclidean space.
For two points \((x_1, y_1, z_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2, z_2)\), the Euclidean distance is calculated using the formula:

{Euclidean Distance} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 + (z_2 - z_1)^2}

It represents the length of the shortest path between two points in a three-dimensional space.

**Manhattan Distance:**
Manhattan distance, also known as city block or L1 distance, measures the distance between two points by summing the absolute differences of their coordinates. 
For two points \((x_1, y_1, z_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2, z_2)\), the Manhattan distance is calculated as:

{Manhattan Distance} = |x_2 - x_1| + |y_2 - y_1| + |z_2 - z_1|

It reflects the distance one would travel in a grid-like pattern, moving only horizontally and vertically.

Both Euclidean and Manhattan distances are commonly used in various applications, such as clustering, classification, and similarity analysis, depending on the nature of the data and the 
context of the problem.
